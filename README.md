# Nesbott
Chatbot for Discord and Trollbox. Nesbott works by splicing together logged messages.

## History
Kevin (AtLeastK) had a website called spooks.me. Spooks was a visual chat website with customizable avatars and tilesets, and Kevin had coded a chatbot for it called Mrs. Nesbott. Sometimes, it was run under the name Separatrix with a robot avatar instead of a french maid avatar. Eventually, Spooks was shut down, but I don't remeber for sure why. It might have been that Kevin's brother, InfraRaven, had some sort of disagreement with Kevin about Spooks. Kevin, disappointed that he could not run Spooks as he wanted to, shut it down as punishment. It also might have been that Kevin got annoyed with some of the people on Spooks, and decided to shut it down as punishment. I eventually started talking with Kevin about Nesbott, and he told me how it worked. He said that he got the idea for Nesbott from an IRC channel's chatbot that someone showed him. I eventually started coding a new Nesbott for Discord, and then Trollbox, as I missed being able to talk to Nesbott on Spooks.
